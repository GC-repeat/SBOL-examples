# BP 008 -- Annotating Entities with Authorship information

Authorship information should ideally be added to `TopLevel` entities where possible. It is RECOMMENDED that the **creator** [DCMI Metadata term](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) SHOULD be used to annotate SBOL entities with authorship information using free text. This property can be repeated for each author.
