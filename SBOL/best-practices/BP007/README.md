# BP 007 -- Annotating Entities with Date & Time

Entities in an SBOL document can be annotated with creation and modification dates. It is RECOMMENDED that predicates, or properties, from DCMI Metadata Terms SHOULD be used to include date and time information. The **created** and **modified** terms SHOULD respectively be used to annotate SBOL entities with creation and modification dates. Date and time values SHOULD be expressed using the XML Schema **DateTime** datatype (Biron et al. 2004). For example, **2016-03-16T20:12:00Z** specifies that the day is 16 March 2016 and the time is 20:12pm in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
